# Simple-COFH-World-Config-Generator
A very simple python GUI to help with making COFH world configs.
It will help those who aren't big fans of working with json files (like myself).

## How to install and use
Works on COFH for Minecraft 1.12.2. It might work for other versions that use the same formatting in the config, no guarantees.
Requires Python 3 and some knowledge on how to run a python script. It's pretty simple and Google is your friend if you need help with this.

To install, just copy the .pyw file into your .minecraft/config/cofh/world folder. It shouldn't conflict with any configs.
You can rename the file to anything you like as long as the extension is .py or .pyw.
By default, the folder will already have existing configs ('00_minecraft.json' or '01_thermalfoundation_ores.json')

Run the script with Python, either by right-clicking and selecting "Open With" or you can use Command Prompt/Powershell.

## Notes:
It's probably far from perfect. If you're good with python feel free to change the code to suit your needs. I made this mainly for myself because I got tired of having remember how json works whenever I have to redo my configs for every new modpack I made.
For the curious, you can open the script with a text editor like Notepad to see the source code.

# Enjoy!
